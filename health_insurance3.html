                            <p>A fine day on your office couch, with deadlines to meet you know that you are fine-up on
                                the corporate ladder, but the
                                one thing that’s bugging you is the uncanny back pain.</p>
                            <p>You go to a doctor only to find that the diagnostic procedures cost you a handsome amount
                                of money at the end of the
                                day.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>The money that you so wanted to spend on new furniture, maybe got completely exhausted in
                            paying up the hospital
                            bills.
                            If this is the scenario for normal diagnosis, imagine how high the amount might go for
                            hospitalization for about a
                            week?</p>
                        <h4 class="subheading">Are you afraid now thinking about how easily you can end up your
                            hard-earned money in a situation that could have been

                            our much precious health.</p>

                        <p>Even if we set targets of hitting the gym or running an extra mile, we end up getting caught
                            up in our daily chores.</p>

                        <h4>But does that mean we have to go on with the risk like forever?</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>The answer to it is a big no.</p>
                        <p>One can easily avoid the risk by opting for health insurance and cover future hazards.</p>
                        <p>But we do know that you might have sometimes thought of signing up for a health insurance

                            <p>It assures you that even if you are down with an illness, or injured you would not be
                                down with financial needs. It
                                gives you a shield or blanket protection that when your health needs the care and
                                pamper, you won’t worry about your

                            keeps you prepared for
                            your
                            unwelcome guests.</p>
                        <p>It is generally considered that the better prepared you are for risk, the better are your
                            chances of
                            surviving it. A bolt from the blue may come, but it shouldn’t wreck you financially and
                            emotionally.</p>

                                <p>Planning early to opt for a health insurance policy may bag you the best deals in the
                                    market. When you are young, you
                                    get higher financial coverage at a lesser price which goes on increasing as you grow
                                    older.</p>
                                <p>Plus, you have a better chance of completing the waiting period for certain surgeries
                                    and pre-existing illness coverage.
                                    Additionally, you get covered for diseases that you might get diagnosed at a later
                                    stage in your life.</p>

                                    vector-borne diseases, maternity benefits which may extend to your newborn without

                                <p>Comprehensive policy plans not only to avert future financial risk but also makes you
                                    stand at an edge over others in
                                    managing your financial portfolio.</p>
                                <p>When you know that you are covered well enough for any future health threat, you may
