                <p class="paragraphBu">Life Insurance is the safest and the most secure way to protect your family or
                    dependents against
                    financial contingencies that may arise post the unfortunate event of your untimely demise. Under a Life
                    Insurance
                    Contract in India, the insurer assures to pay a definite sum to the policyholder’s family on his demise
                    during the
                    policy term.</p>

                <p class="paragraphBu">A life insurance policy is an agreement between an insurance company &amp; a
                    policyholder
                    that offers financial coverage under which the insurance company guarantees to pay a certain amount to
                    the
                    nominated beneficiary in the unfortunate event of the insured person demise during the term of life
                    insurance
                    plans.&nbsp;In exchange, the policyholder agrees to pay a predefined sum of money in form of premiums
                    either on
                    a regular basis or as a lump sum. If included in the contract, some other contingencies, such as a
                    critical
                    illness or a terminal illness can also trigger the payment of benefit. If defined in the contract, some
                    other
                    things, such as funeral expenses might also be a part of the benefits.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If mentioned in the contract, a policy may also cover some other costs like funeral
                    expenses
                    as a part of benefits.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Except for the death benefits, a life insurance plan also provides maturity benefits.
                    These
                    benefits are provided in the form of a payout if the insured survives the entire term of the policy.
                    Moreover,
                    life insurance schemes also offer several tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

                <p class="paragraphBu">The <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/?pb_source=organic">insurance</a> company
                    will
                    determine the premium payment that has to be made by the policyholder to the company. However, the
                    claimant is
                    given the option to choose the term of the policy and the sum assured. A number of factors are taken
                    into
                    consideration while determining the premium amount for every individual. The sum assured is amongst
                    those
                    factors. Higher the sum assured, higher the amount of the premium.</p>

                <h2>Why Need of Buying Life Insurance?</h2>
                <p class="paragraphBu">It acts as a financial net for an eventuality linked with human life, such as
                    retirement,
                    disability, accident, death, etc. Life is unpredictable; one can never guess what happens next. In case
                    of
                    sudden demise of the primary breadwinner of a family, apart from the emotional trauma, his/her family is
                    at the
                    risk of a financial crunch. In case this person is the sole breadwinner of the family, his/her
                    dependents face a
                    loss of income.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Though there is no premium calculator that can calculate the worth of a human life,
                    what
                    needs to be done must be done. To calculate the sum assured, the insurer takes your lifestyle and
                    finances into
                    consideration. This sum assured is provided to insured’s family after his/her demise in order to offer
                    them a
                    much-needed financial support. In order to make sure that one’s family doesn’t have to make any
                    compromises due
                    to financial crunches, one should buy a suitable life plan.</p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li><strong>Unpredictability</strong>-Life is unpredictable. One can’t predict when his/her life will
                        come to an
                        end. If it were up to people, nobody would want to leave without ensuring the financial security of
                        his/her
                        family. Sadly, it’s not up to them. The solution is, one must buy life insurance and be a step ahead
                        so that
                        the financial goals set for his/her family can be accomplished even when he/she isn’t around.</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial Cushion</strong>- It provides much-needed financial support to insured’s family by
                        compensating for the loss of income.</li>
                    <li><strong>Debt-Proof Future</strong>- The sudden demise of a breadwinner is nothing short of a
                        catastrophe.
                        While it is an emotional crisis initially, it can get converted into a financial one in no time.
                        With the
                        help of life insurance, any outstanding debt, such as a motor loan, personal loan, a home loan, etc.
                        would
                        be taken care.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Accomplishment of Retirement Goals</strong>- While life plan is a perfect option to
                        accomplish
                        long-term goals, it helps accomplish retirement goals as well. Some life insurance plans offer
                        diverse
                        investment opportunities and some insurance plans offer performance-based dividends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tax Benefits</strong>- A policyholder can avail tax-benefits regardless the type of life
                        insurance
                        he/she purchases. As per section 80 C of the income tax act, the premium paid towards an plan is
                        eligible
                        for tax benefits up to Rs. 1 lakh 50 thousand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mental Peace- </strong>It offers much-needed peace of mind to the policyholder by assuring
                        financial
                        future of his/her family. Even a basic plan helps to generate corpus to take care of the future
                        financial
                        needs of insured’s family.</li>
                    <li><strong>Savings Tool</strong>- In case a person opts for a traditional/unit-linked plan, he/she pays
                        an
                        enhanced insurance premium. This extra amount of money is invested in the insured’s preferred fund
                        and
                        consequently acts as a savings tool.</li>
                    <li><strong>Children’s Future Expenses</strong>- A life plan takes care of all the future expenses of a
                        policyholder’s children, such as education and wedding expenses. These days, the cost of raising a
                        child is
                        sky-high. Not just that, even getting admission in a reputed college costs a bomb. This policy
                        ensures that
                        the policyholder’s children don’t have to make any compromises as far as their education and
                        personal needs
                        are concerned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Security</strong><strong>-</strong> While some life insurance plans cater to the
                        needs of
                        the insured and his/her family, there are some insurance plans available in the market that offer
                        support to
                        the insured’s business. It also enables a business partner to buy the share of his/her deceased
                        business
                        partner.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Once he/she knows what he wants, the next step is to shop around and compare life
                    insurance

                <h2>Benefits of Life Insurance Plans</h2>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The perks of buying a life insurance policy go beyond protecting one’s family in
                    tough times.
                    Undoubtedly, it is a necessity to safeguard one’s dependents (in case of one’s unfortunate and untimely
                    demise,
                    accidents or physical disabilities that lead to a loss of income), but there is a long list of other
                    benefits,
                    too, that make it a lucrative choice among individuals.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Sadly, most people are not aware of the many benefits associated with it - all they
                    care
                    about, understandably, are the death and disability benefits. However, there is a long list of benefits
                    attached
                    to the policy such as maturity benefits, tax benefits etc.</p>

                        <h3>Loan Against a Life Insurance Policy:</h3>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">Till date, many people don’t know that life insurance policies can also be
                            used to
                            secure a loan at a significantly more competitive rate as compared to other modes. One can get a
                            loan
                            from the same company or a bank or NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company).</p>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">The maximum amount of loan an individual will be able to get depends upon the
                            type
                            and surrender value of his/her policy.</p>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">Generally, the loan amount is a percentage of the surrender value of the life
                            indemnity policy and it can go up to as high as 80% to 90%. There are few companies that only
                            allow
                            loans amounting to 50 percent of the total premium amount paid by the policyholders to calculate
                            the
                            maximum loan amount they can be eligible
                            for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <h3>Online Payment Rebate:</h3>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">Most individuals have never heard about the online payment rebate benefit,
                            but it’s
                            important to note that the payment mode chosen by an individual drastically affects the premium
                            of a
                            life insurance policy. In fact, an insurance company’s servicing cost considerably goes down
                            when an
                            individual opts to pay his premiums online.</p>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">This is because there is no cost involved on paperwork in this case.
                            Therefore, the
                            life insurance company is able to save a significant amount on the commission, which is
                            generally paid
                            to the agents.</p>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">Varying from company to company, this rebate might have already been given to
                            the
                            policyholders before the online premium rates are quoted to them.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="numbers">
                        <h3>Refund on the Sum Assured</h3>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">This benefit might surprise many customers, but there are many life insurance
                            companies that offer rebates for a higher sum assured. This is because the servicing cost of all
                            the
                            policies belonging to the same category is almost the same; hence, a higher sum assured means a
                            lower
                            cost of servicing per unit of sum assured, for the insurance company. Subsequently, this
                            translates to
                            higher returns or profits per unit of the sum assured/premium paid, which explains the rebate on
                            the sum
                            assured.</p>

                        <p class="paragraphBu">Almost every insurance company offers the periodic payment option to its
                            customers
                            which can be in the annual, half yearly, quarterly or monthly mode.</p>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">In this case, the higher the frequency of payment one chooses, the higher the
                            servicing cost will be (comprising of administrative, processing and collection costs) for the
                            insurance
                            company.</p>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">Furthermore, if a policyholder chooses to pay his premium at one go for the
                            complete
                            year, the company can use the available funds for investment purpose which automatically means
                            more
                            profits and benefits for the company.</p>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">This rebate is often already included into the premium rate offered by the
                            company
                            once a customer chooses the periodicity for the payment.</p>

                        <h3>Taking Care of One’s Business</h3>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">There are some life insurance companies that provide an option, wherein if
                            the
                            policyholder owns a business, his business partners can purchase his share without any hassles
                            (after
                            the policyholder’s death). In this scenario, the business partner/s will simply have to enter
                            into an
                            agreement with the insurance company and the pay-out received after selling the policyholder’s
                            share
                            will be given to his dependents.</p>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">However, it’s important to understand here that the nominee or the dependents
                            of the
                            policyholders do not get a stake in the company.</p>

                        <h3>Tax benefits</h3>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">Under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, any amount of life insurance premium
                            paid by
                            a policyholder is eligible for a tax rebate, irrespective of the fact if it’s for oneself, their
                            spouse
                            or their children (premium paid for parents and in-laws is exempted).</p>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">The policyholder will get the tax rebate facility for all the premiums he is
                            paying
                            and this benefit is available with all the life insurance companies – be it from private sector
                            or
                            public. This benefit has been explained further below.</p>
                        <p class="paragraphBu">An individual can save taxes under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
                            Under
                            this section of the IT Act, the premiums paid towards the policy are eligible for tax deduction.
                            What’s
                            more, the insurance policies, which offer maturity benefits, also qualify for tax deductions on

                    riders available in the market, one shouldn’t randomly buy one for the sake of increasing the cover
                    amount. In
                    this regard, here are some of the rider options available for insurance seekers:</p>
                <h3><strong>Accidental Death Benefit Rider</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">With this rider, in case of the accidental death of the insured, the nominee will
                    receive the
                    policy amount along with the rider benefit. In many cases, the death doesn’t occur on-the-spot, so most
                    of the
                    insurance companies set a period after the incident to extend the offered cover. Lets’ say, if the
                    policyholder
                    dies after 100 days of the accident, the nominee still receives the sum assured. That’s why, it is
                    imperative to
                    check the policy clause carefully at the time of buying a rider.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">As eventualities come without prior notice, anybody can take this rider. However, it
                    is a
                    must buy for those who-</p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li>Commute and travel by car, bike, public or commercial vehicles, on a daily basis.</li>
                    <li>Someone who frequently does business trips or if the job involves physical work in a factory or
                        on-site
                        civil work</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><strong>Accidental Total and Permanent Disability Rider</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If the insured person is unable to earn a daily income due to the accident which
                    leads to
                    total temporary or permanent disability, this rider provides financial assistance to the family. In such
                    unfortunate situations, the insurance company bears the monthly income of the insured. The rider benefit
                    may
                    vary plan to plan and it is paid for a pre-decided time period. For instance, some companies offer rider
                    benefits for 5 to 10 years from the occurrence of the accident. In case of the death of the insured
                    during the
                    policy term due to suffering, the beneficiary would receive the outstanding sum assured amount.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">This rider is important to buy for the individuals who-</p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li>Commutes and travel by car, bike, train, public or commercial vehicle, on daily basis.</li>
                    <li>Someone who frequently does business trips or if the job involves physical work in a factory or
                        on-site
                        civil work</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><strong> Critical Illness Rider</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">This rider covers major critical ailments like cancer, heart attack, kidney failure,
                    stroke,
                    coma, paralysis, etc. As the coverage may differ from insurer to insurer, it is important to check the
                    list of
                    illnesses included by the company.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The insurance company offers the rider benefits on the detection of a critical
                    illness.
                    Though any of the above listed critical illnesses may not cause immediate death, the treatment could
                    cost a bomb
                    or could force the insured to leave the job. In such situation, the insured is compensated using this
                    rider plan
                    where the given money can be used is monthly expenses or in the treatment. However, the pay-out may vary
                    as some
                    insurer offers 100% of the basic sum assured and others don’t . The only condition is that the life
                    assured will
                    have to survive a waiting period.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">As no one can predict such an illness, this rider can be bought by anybody,
                    especially</p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li>Top-level officers with extreme work stress</li>
                    <li>Chain-smokers</li>
                    <li>Someone with unhealthy lifestyle</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><strong> Waiver of Premium</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If the insured is unable to pay the premium due to any disability that leaves him/her
                    with no
                    income, the life insurance policy terminates. In such cases, the insured wouldn’t be offered any
                    compensation.
                    Then, how will the family manage without an income?</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">In such a situation, Waver of Premium rider is a savior, as all the future premiums
                    will be
                    waived off and the policy will be in force as before.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">In case the premiums are not paid due to the death of the policyholder or accidental
                    disability, the premium for the main policy and riders will be excused and the policy will continue.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Usually, this rider can be bought along with Critical Illness and Accidental Total
                    and
                    Permanent Disability Rider. If not, the insured has to buy it separately. As uncertainties can’t be
                    predicted,
                    one should buy this rider, especially those who-</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Commutes and travel by car, bike, public or commercial vehicle, train on daily basis.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Someone who frequently goes on business trips through flights or if the job involves
                    physical
                    work in a factory or on-site civil work</p>
                <h3><strong>Accelerated Death Benefit Rider</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">This rider works as a saviour in case the policyholder is detected with a critical
                    illness
                    such as cancer, AIDS, leukemia, Ebola etc., which may shorten the lifespan of the insured. In such
                    cases, the
                    insurer pays a portion of the base sum assured in advance. This can be utilised for the treatment or for
                    paying
                    monthly expenses. The remaining money will be paid to the family on the death of the insured to secure
                    their
                    financial future.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Before taking any decision, a thorough analysis of lifestyle or surroundings is
                    required.
                    Based on this, the insurance seekers should decide whether they need this rider or not.</p>
                <h3><strong>Term Rider</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">This rider offers a monthly income or lump sum to the beneficiary in the event of the
                    premature death of the insured. The benefit can be equal to the base sum assured which is pre-determined
                    by the
                    insurer.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Importance - Someone who wants to leave behind a huge death benefit.</p>
                <h3><strong>Hospital Cash Rider</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Under this rider a fixed amount is paid in case of emergency/planned hospitalization.
                    The
                    benefit amount, terms and conditions, and sum assured may vary from insurer to insurer.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">This plan is for those who want to cover expenses related to emergency
                    hospitalization</p>
                <h3><strong>Surgical Care Rider</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If the insured undergoes an unavoidable surgery in India, under this rider plan, a
                    lump sum
                    amount will be paid. However, the rider benefit may vary plan to plan or may vary from minor to major
                    surgery.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">This plan can be purchased by anyone who wants to cover the expenses for surgery in
                    case of
                    any eventualities. This helps in mitigating any out-of-pocket expenses that may burn a hole in one’s

                    there
                    are certain situations in which your insurance company can decline your claim. It is recommended that

                <p class="paragraphBu">Life insurance is the simplest form of insurance which helps secure the financial
                    future of
                    the insured’s family, following his/her unfortunate demise. It can be purchased anytime, however, it has
                    a
                    changed meaning when purchased at a specific age, owing to variation in lifestyle and financial goals.
                    The best
                    age to buy term insurance is as early as possible. The reason is, one can avail the plan at an economic
                    price
                    due to low risk associated with a younger age. If the advice of financial experts is to be considered,
                    the
                    starting month of the financial year (April) is the best time to reassess one’s financial plans. On the

                    career or start making decisions on their own during this period. Though one may have less
                    responsibility,
                    re-paying debts and impending dependency must be taken into consideration.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">In this regard, It helps a person mitigate all these risks. One big benefit of
                    purchasing
                    life insurance at this age is that one can avail a reasonably priced plan with a low premium, since the
                    risk to
                    the policyholder’s life is comparatively less. In other words, younger the policyholder, the cheaper the
                    premiums will be.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">In line with this, one can avail plan with a sum assured of Rs. 50 lakh for a yearly
                    premium
                    of Rs. 3776.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>At the Age of the 30s</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">This is the time when most people get married or start a family. With this,
                    responsibilities
                    also increase manifold. Not only people start thinking about securing the future of their child, but
                    also worry
                    about financial liabilities like car loans, home loans or other long-term commitments that require their
                    utmost
                    attention. However, the income usually increases with age and the standard of living also improves, in
                    turn,
                    making the expenses to spiral. Therefore, this the time that one thinks of buying life insurance to
                    protect the
                    financial future of the family. One can go for term plan with a monthly income option. This plan allows
                    availing
                    a monthly lump sum amount to pay-off the debts, if any. This could be a great financial backing for the
                    family
                    and can help bear day-to-day expenses in the absence of the sole earning member.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>At the Age of 40</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">At the age of 40s, usually, there are long-term debts like home loan, car loan etc.
                    Moreover,
                    responsibilities like a child’s higher education, retirement planning, expenditure on old parents’ ill
                    health
                    etc., need a considerable amount of someone’s finances. Thus, one will require a comprehensive cover
                    that
                    secures the future of his/her family. Buying a plan with a larger sum assured is recommended at this
                    age.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">When a 40-year male non-smoker can purchase policy with Sum Assured of Rs. 50 lakh,
                    the
                    premium will cost around Rs. 7198/year. The same Sum Assured at the age of 50, will be available at Rs.
                    Rs.
                    12,626/year. So, one shouldn’t delay in buying life insurance.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>At the Age of 50</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">When someone is more than 50 years old, the premium of life or term insurance appears
                    to
                    double as compared to what a 30-years old pays. No matter if one smokes or not, the premium will always
                    be
                    higher at this age. Despite this, it is recommended that one invest on a plan, especially if he/she is
                    the
                    breadwinner of the family or has huge financial liabilities to pay off.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>At the Age 65</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Many may think that over 65 years of age, they won’t be able to avail term or life
                    insurance
                    coverage. But, it’s not like that. One can buy it. The only thing he/she has to compromise on is the
                    policy
                    term, i.e. at this age, going for a 30-year plan doesn’t make any sense nor would one get the approval.
                    Moreover, there are senior citizen plans specially designed to cater the needs of this age group. These
                    plans
                    come with affordable premium as well. At the age of 65 or more, one can go for a term or whole life that
                    offers
                    complete financial protection when there is no or less inflow of money.</p>

            <div class="block_content_wrapper">
                <h2>How Does Age Affect Life Insurance Premium Rates?</h2>
                <p class="paragraphBu">While purchasing a policy, it is very important to compare life insurance policies
                    online and
                    understand the process of premium calculation of different types of policies. As we have earlier
                    mentioned,
                    there are various factors that determine the premium rate of a policy. One’s age is the most important
                    factor
                    that plays a vital role in determining the premium amount.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The premium amount rises by 8-10% every year due to the increase in the insured’s
                    age. So, it
                    is always beneficial to purchase an indemnity policy while one’s young. If the insurance buyer is young,
                    the
                    premium rates of the policy will be low when compared to the premium rates for someone older. This is
                    because
                    young individuals tend to be less prone to life-threatening diseases and the possibility of death at
                    such a
                    young age is very unlikely. Moreover, purchasing a life insurance policy at a young age can help the
                    insured
                    save a lot of money in long run.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">As a person grows older, the life expectancy of that person decreases, thus, they
                    become
                    riskier to insure. Rather than increasing the premium of the policy on every birthday of the insured,
                    the
                    insurance company spreads the premiums one would pay over 10, 20 or 30 years depending on the entry age
                    of the
                    insured and averages them into one amount. So, the premium amount paid by the insurance holder remains
                    the same
                    every year. However, the rate increases every year by 5-8% if an individual is in his/her 40s and 9-12%
                    if an
                    individual is above 50 years of age.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If a person waits to buy life insurance at a later stage in life, then he/she loses
                    out on
                    the earlier, low-risk years that lower the average and end up paying more. Besides this, purchasing a
                    life
                    insurance plan at older age can also lead to more hassles during the process of application. The insurer
                    might
                    ask the insurance buyers to do extra tests like EKGs and cognitive testing for dementia before
                    purchasing the
                    policy.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">However, paying more for indemnity policy does not disqualify an individual from
                    actually
                    getting it. It just means that the insured will have to pay a little extra every month. Having said
                    this, paying
                    a little extra in order to safeguard the future of your loved ones is wiser than not having a protection
                    plan.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Moreover, there are many life cover policies that are designed to cater the
                    requirements of
                    the individuals in their sunset years. These types of life inurance coverage policies may cover
                    accidental death
                    or final expenses that specifically cover burial/cremation costs.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">In case of guaranteed whole life insurance, the insured does not have to undergo any
                    medical
                    tests and may be covered for a higher sum assured. This type is specifically designed to protect the
                    family of
                    the insured from the burden of paying for the final expenses. For those life insurance policies that
                    provide
                    accidental death insurance, age is not a factor for the insured, plus they don’t have to undergo any
                    medical
                    tests. However, coverage against accidental death can only be provided to the insured if they have taken
                    accidental rider benefit along with the policy.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Age is the key factor to consider while zeroing on a life insurance plan. Young
                    individuals
                    who have a good medical history and have taken their first steps into a married life, should definitely
                    consider
                    purchasing a policy as it provides life protection to the family of the insured at a low premium cost.
                </p>
                <h3>How Much Insurance Cover Does One Need?</h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If one has dependents to take care of, but insufficient assets to cater to their
                    needs in
                    one’s absence, it’s understood that s/he will need a life insurance policy. However, the next major
                    question
                    which comes up is how can one calculate the worth of their life, i.e. how much money will one need?
                    Although,
                    it’s the kind of question that nobody wants to ask, but when it comes to buying a life insurance, one
                    should
                    certainly be clear of this figure.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">There is no denying the fact that the primary purpose of a life coverage policy is to
                    provide
                    financial aid to the policyholder’s dependents in case something unfortunate happens to him/her. Hence,
                    the
                    cover amount should be adequate to clear up all dues and generate a regular income source for the family
                    of the
                    insured.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The amount of life insurance cover that one will need actually depends upon the
                    individual’s
                    circumstances and the type of plan s/he is looking for. For example, one can be looking for a plan to
                    protect
                    one’s mortgage, cover debts, or to provide a lump sum amount to his loved ones to help them maintain
                    their
                    standard of living.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">One’s insurance cover amount can be easily calculated using a few basic tips:</p>
                <h3>How much does one owe?</h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The amount of debt one has to their name should be an important factor while
                    finalizing the
                    cover amount for a life insurance policy. This is because one would not want to force their family to
                    deal with
                    debt collectors or struggle to make ends meet, thanks to an unpaid debt.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">For instance, if Mr Kumar has a debt of Rs 20 lakhs, he should opt for a life
                    insurance plan
                    that will provide at least 50 lakh. This way his family will be able to repay the loan and also be left
                    with a
                    substantial remainder to live their lives comfortably. In order to ensure that his policy will cover the
                    debt,
                    Mr Kumar must regularly pay the interest on his debt to smiddle it from snowballing into a large sum.
                </p>
                <h3>How much regular income does one’s dependents need to maintain their standard of living?</h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Income replacement again plays a vital role in determining the cover amount one is
                    going to
                    need.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Let’s say, Rohit earns Rs 10 lakh a year after tax and other deductions from his
                    salary. In
                    case he is not around, the expenses that were spent on him can be deducted, and hence the required
                    income can be
                    an estimated 80 percent of Rs 10 lakhs, i.e. Rs 8 lakh. In this case, he will need a life insurance
                    policy,
                    which after his investments, will provide his family members with a minimum income of Rs 8 lakhs.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Again, the next crucial part is deciding for how long his family members are going to
                    need
                    this income. In this example, Rs 1 crore as the sum assured should be sufficient for 15 years, and Rs
                    1.5 crores
                    for the next 25 years, assuming a real rate of inflation at 2.5 per cent annually, in the long term.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Furthermore, to decide the number of years that Rohit must replace his income, he
                    will need
                    to estimate the age at which his investments and savings will make him financially independent. He can
                    either
                    use the traditional retirement age of 60 years or contact a financial advisor to do the calculations for
                    him.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If Rohit’s wife Shikha is also working and he is partially dependent upon her income
                    for his
                    expenses, he can still follow the same principle for the income replacement. All he has to do is account
                    for his
                    wife’s financial contribution to the family while calculating the life cover amount.</p>
                <h3><strong>Are there any future financial liabilities to take care of?</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">There may be certain future needs to account for (such as one’s kids’ higher
                    education,
                    wedding, etc.), while calculating the cover amount. One has to estimate the cost involved in these
                    future
                    expenditures and add them to the insurance cover.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">It’s also advised that policyholders re-evaluate their life insurance policies
                    periodically
                    to ensure that they have an adequate cover, especially on the occurrence of major life events such as
                    buying a
                    new house against a loan, child’s birth, etc. One can’t follow the ‘one size fits all’ approach to
                    decide the
                    coverage amount policy. Besides one’s personal circumstances, one also needs to have a fair idea of how
                    much
                    s/he can afford to pay in monthly premiums.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">There are a range of affordable indemnity policies available in the market offering
                    flexible
                    options to the customers in the form of regular income pay-out or a lump sum amount. By making a few
                    right
                    decisions, one can easily get an affordable life insurance policy.</p>

                <h2>Claim Settlement Ratios of Life Insurance Companies in India</h2>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Presently, 24 companies sell life insurance plans in India. Of all these 24
                    providers, the
                    only provider under public sector is the LIC of India. The rest of the 23 companies are either private
                    or JVs
                    between national or international insurance/finance companies and private or public sector
                    banks/financial
                    institutions.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The access to life insurance sector was given to the private life insurers in the
                    year 2000.
                    Also, most of the private insurers have partnered with the international insurance players to bring up
                    their
                    insurance venture.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">An important parameter to judge the middle insurance company is by its Claim
                    Settlement
                    Ratio.</p>
                <h3><strong> What is Claim Settlement Ratio?</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">A Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR) is the ratio of the total number of claims that an
                    insurance
                    provider settles to the total number of claims it receives in a year. CSR for life insurance providers
                    is issued
                    by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) of India, every year.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The formula to calculate the Claim Settlement Ratio is as follows:</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Claim Settlement Ration = Total number of claims approved and paid by the
                    insurer/Total
                    number of claims received by the insurance company*100</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">For example, if the number of death claims received by the insurance provider is
                    1000, out of
                    which it settles 980, the Claim Settlement Ration of that provider would be 98%.</p>

                    cycle. It
                    is important to have the right approach to make a death claim. Here’s how nominees of the deceased
                    insured can
                    make a claim in India –</p>

                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li>On the demise of the Policyholder</li>

                        style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.16px;">Inform
                        the Insurance Company</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Contact the insurer as soon as possible on their toll-free number or inform them over
                    email.
                    It is always preferable to inform the insurer directly over a call to initiate the process.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Claim Intimation</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The beneficiary or the claimant while lodging a claim with the insurance company
                    needs to
                    share all the important details like –</p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li>The Policy Number</li>
                    <li>Name of the policyholder</li>
                    <li>Place of death</li>
                    <li>Name of the insured</li>
                    <li>Name of the claimant</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If the life insurance policy has been purchased offline, then the insurer will
                    provide a
                    claim intimation form at the time of the policy purchase.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If it is an online insurance policy, it is simple to apply for the claim form online.

                <p class="paragraphBu">In case of an accidental or natural death, the beneficiary or the nominees need to
                    submit all
                    the supporting documents to the insurance company as a part of the claim process.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The claim support team will evaluate the insurance documents and claim declaration,
                    and will
                    validate the same. In some cases, they might ask to the beneficiary submit a few other documents.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong style="font-size: 12.16px;">Documents to be submitted</strong></p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li>The original copy of the insurance policy</li>
                    <li>The claim form and the death certificate of the deceased person.</li>
                    <li>If someone other than the assignee or the nominee makes the claim, the insurance company can ask for
                        the
                        legal title of succession.</li>
                    <li>Deeds of assignment, if any</li>
                    <li>Discharge form signed by witnesses</li>
                    <li>The investigation report in case of police inquiries</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Approval and Pay-out</strong><br> <br> Once all the documents have been
                    submitted,
                    and the insurance company has looked into the veracity of the claim thoroughly, the claim will be
                    settled by the
                    insurer.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The life insurance company can ask for the beneficiary’s bank details – a canceled
                    cheque or
                    a copy of the bank account passbook, which has been attested by the bank authorities.<br> <br> For
                    nominee's
                    identity proof, a copy of passport, Voter identity card, PAN card, Aadhar card etc. need to be
                    submitted.<br>
                    <br> Generally, the claim settlement process takes 30 days. But once it is approved, the insurer
                    immediately
                    makes the payout.<br> <br> Some insurers make the payments through the Electronic Clearance Service or
                    ECS,
                    which is an alternative method to make bulk payments.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Aforementioned are the basic set of documents that are required to process a claim.
                </p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li>Here are few other documents that the insurer can ask for (if need be) –</li>
                    <li>Employer’s certificate</li>
                    <li>Some other forms or reports to support the investigation or verification</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><strong>Claim Process to be followed on Maturity of the Life Insurance Policy</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If the insured outlives the policy term, he/she will be eligible to claim maturity
                    benefits.
                    Make sure the policy is ongoing and that all the premiums have been duly paid.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">There is a clear-cut process to file a maturity claim and it involves minimal
                    paperwork.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">When the policy is about to mature, the life insurance company generally intimates
                    the
                    policyholder at least 1-2 months in advance. All the details regarding the maturity date, maturity
                    amount, and
                    discharge voucher are provided to the insured.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The discharge voucher (similar to a receipt) has to be signed by the policyholder in
                    the
                    presence of witnesses. The voucher is then sent back to the insurer along with the original policy bond,
                    on the
                    basis of which the payment is released.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">In case the policyholder has assigned the policy to another individual or entity,
                    then the
                    assignee must give the discharge voucher to the insurer, in order to receive the claim amount.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Points to Remember-</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">This process is applicable only to life insurance policies with maturity benefits
                    like
                    additional bonus, survival benefits, etc.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">In the event of the demise of the policyholder after the maturity date of the life
                    insurance,
                    but during the policy discharge procedures, it will be considered as a maturity claim. And the claim
                    amount will
                    be paid out to the nominees of the deceased policyholder.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>The Revelation of all the Facts</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">At the time of buying a new policy, one must mention the details of any previously
                    purchased
                    policy so that they’re aware of the existing policy and can help the insurance seeker choose the right
                    policy as
                    per his/her needs. Otherwise, misrepresentation can be a reason for the rejection of death claim.</p>

                    enable him/her to purchase life insurance online.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">There are two ways to buy an insurance policy online: either by visiting the official
                    website
                    of the insurer or comparing plans through an online aggregator website. These websites allow the
                    insurance
                    seekers to compare policies on parameters such as premium, benefits, claim settlement ratio etc. This
                    way, one
                    can weigh the pros and cons of a policy and meets his/her insurance needs. Below are the steps:</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong style="font-size: 12.16px;">Provide Basic Details</strong></p>

                    such as
                    name, date of birth, contact number, smoking habit (if any), income and expected life cover. Once this
                    information is given, a suitable indemnity plan with benefits and features will be shown on-screen. Once

                    with going through the overall plan, the customer can select the right policy that meets his/her
                    requirement and
                    clicking on available suggested options.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong style="font-size: 12.16px;">Pay the Premium</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The next step is to pay the insurance premium online. One can pay the premium using
                    the
                    available payment mode. Once the payment successful, a confirmation message will be sent to the
                    registered
                    contact number or e-mail id provided by the customer.<br> <br> The basic procedure for issuing a policy
                    also
                    includes filling a life insurance proposal form. The customer needs to fill this form once the insurance
                    premium
                    is paid. This form requires the insurance seeker to fill relevant particulars like personal details,
                    existing
                    life cover (if any), health details, and finally, lifestyle and nominee details. Everything detail needs
                    to be
                    authentic.<br> <br> <strong>Furnish Relevant Documents</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Next, the customer needs to provide relevant documents, such as identity proof,
                    address proof
                    and health certificates. The ‘to-be-uploaded’ list of documents will be sent to the insurance seeker at
                    the time
                    of filling the form.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Pre-policy Health Test</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Some insurers have made it mandatory for the proposer to undergo a medical test. In
                    such
                    cases, the customer needs to present the test report. If the insurance company suggests any medical
                    centre for
                    the test, the medical centre will directly send the test report to the insurer.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Issue of Policy</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">After verifying the proposal, including documents and medical test reports, the
                    insurer will
                    decide whether to issue life insurance policy or not. If the application is approved, its confirmation
                    will be
                    sent to the applicant along with the policy document</p>

                    own pro
                    and cons and each is quite difficult to comprehend at the first glance.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">So, here’s a quick rundown of certain facts that you must consider to make the right
                    purchase
                    –</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Time Period</strong> - It is one of the most important deciding factors in
                    selecting
                    the right indemnity plan. If you want a lifelong insurance plan which can see to your family’s
                    well-being after
                    your demise, then a whole life plan is the right choice. It offers a death benefit for as long as you
                    are alive.
                    You should look for a plan that offers you your Human Life Value, and includes a salary cover and loan
                    reimbursements (if you require).</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If you need a protection plan for a certain time period, you can go for term
                    insurance. If
                    you want to save some funds for your children’s education, then you can buy a 10-year term a life
                    insurance plan
                    with return of premium add-on.<br> <br> To pay off your debts, you can buy a plan for that specific
                    period. You
                    can check out various other types of plans like ULIPS, Pension Plans, Money back plans, Endowment plans
                    etc.,
                    based on the time-period and your needs.<br> <br> It is recommended that you buy life insurance at a
                    young age.
                    You will be able to accumulate more saving that way.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Premium</strong> - If you want to buy just for investment or tax-saving
                    purposes,
                    then the premium is a crucial deciding factor. For example, the premium amount for endowment plans, Unit
                    Linked
                    Insurance Policies, and Whole life policies are on a higher side when compared to Term Insurance, Money
                    Back
                    Plans and Pension Plans.<br> <br> It is important for you to know that if you are not able to pay the
                    premium on
                    time, your policy can lapse.</p>

                    life
                    insurance plan should be a priority for you. The reason is, in such a case, your family is dependent
                    solely on
                    your income, and nobody wants their loved ones to suffer due to loss of income in case of sudden death.
                    Analyze
                    the number of dependents and search for a plan that provides maximum coverage.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Evaluate the Sum assured of Insurance</strong> - Have a fair estimate of the
                    assured

                    the insurance contract between the insurer and the insured. Alternatively, documentation stands for a
                    compilation of documents that is used as a written evidence of information.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Like in every other segment, insurance companies also need proofs while issuing a
                    life
                    insurance policy. The policy seeker is required to submit all the relevant documents in order to avail
                    the
                    policy. This process is done before the policy is issued. The applicant can either upload it directly by
                    visiting the official website of the insurer or e-mail it to insurer’s customer service id. He/she can
                    courier
                    it to the official address as well. These documents also need to be self-attested by the insured.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">At the time of applying for a policy, the life insurer will ask for the
                    below-mentioned KYC
                    documents:</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Income Certificate</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">This is necessary to estimate the sum assured or cover that is to be offered to the
                    insured.
                    In most the cases, life insurance companies offer a cover up to 20 times the proposer’s annual income.
                    The
                    standard income proofs include:</p>

                </ul>
                <h3><strong>Know About Other Documents of Life Insurance Policy</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Apart from the KYC documents, there are some other documents that the insured must
                    know of.
                    These include:</p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li>Insurance application or proposal, which is the first document in the insurance contract.</li>
                    <li>Policy declaration, which is necessary if someone other than the insured has filled the policy
                        proposal form
                        or if the proposer is not educated.</li>
                    <li>A final declaration at the end stating that all the provided information is true and that if
                        anything is
                        found untrue, the insurer has the right to reject the application. Subsequently, the contract is
                        rendered as
                        null and void and premium paid would be surrendered. Thus, once declared by the proposer, the entire
                        process
                        is completed with utmost faith.</li>
                    <li>In case the policy is required to be registered under Married Women’s Property Act, a separate form
                        needs to
                        be filled and submitted to the insurer, mentioning the nominee and trustees.</li>
                    <li>Policy proposal also includes a personal statement, which is attached to the declaration at the end
                        of the
                        proposal. Any incorrect statement may lead to rejection of the application.</li>
                    <li>As per the IRDA rules, after verifying everything, a copy of the proposal would be sent to the
                        insured
                        within 30 days of the completion of the formalities.</li>
                    <li>IRDAI also states that the insurer must make a decision on the proposal within 15 days.</li>
                    <li>First Premium Receipt is the proof of conclusion of the contract. However, as per the IRDA
                        regulations, the
                        insured can withdraw his/her policy within 15 days of the policy issue date, if not satisfied. This
                        period
                        is called Free-look Period or Cooling-off Period in insurance terms.</li>
                    <li>At the time of paying the annual premium on policy renewal, the insured is provided with a premium
                        receipt
                        which is an important document for further reference.</li>

                <p class="paragraphBu">The premiums differ according to the credentials of the applicant and the plan chosen
                    by an
                    individual. Generally, a younger and healthier individual is likely to have lower premium as compared to
                    a
                    person who is nearing his/her 50s. Similarly, the premium for a non-smoker will generally be lesser,
                    whereas a
                    smoker is likely to be charged a higher premium. Apart from these factors, there are several other
                    factors that
                    determine the premium amount of a policy.</p>

                    the
                    insured is required to pay for the chosen sum assured amount . Also, the premium calculator estimates
                    the
                    premium amount on the basis of the policy chosen and technicalities like age, tenure, premium frequency,
                    etc.
                    While making use of the premium calculator the insured will have to provide certain information like:

                <h2>Steps to Use Life Insurance Premium Calculator</h2>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Filling the information in the life insurance premium calculator and getting the
                    premium
                    quotes of the policies is a simple and hassle-free process. One just needs to follow these three simple
                    steps in
                    order to calculate the premium of the policy with the help of a premium calculator:</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Step 1-&nbsp;</strong>Enter personal information like date of birth, marital
                    status,
                    gender, annual income, life cover, number of dependents, etc. The customers may also be required to
                    mention
                    their smoking habits.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Steps 2-</strong>&nbsp;Once the policy buyer has entered their personal
                    information,
                    he/she will have to enter the amount of sum assured they want and for how many years. Moreover, the
                    customer
                    will also have to mention how they would like their family to receive the benefits i.e. in a lump-sum or
                    as a
                    monthly income.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Step 3</strong>- In the final step, the premium calculator will display some
                    relevant
                    plans as per the details filled by the customers. The insurance seekers can compare plans and choose the
                    most
                    beneficial plan according to their suitability.</p>
                <h3><strong>Factors that Affect Life Insurance Premium</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Before zeroing in on a policy, it is important to understand how the annual premium
                    is
                    determined. Irrespective of the type of policy one wants to buy, its annual premium depends upon various
                    factors
                    of the insureds’ life. Listed below are some of the important factors that affect the premium of an
                    indemnity
                    plan.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Personal Factors</strong></p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li><strong>Age-&nbsp;</strong>The age of the insurance buyer is directly proportional to the premium of
                        the
                        policy. So, it is best to get a policy as early as possible. Younger individuals are considered to
                        be
                        healthier as compared to older individuals and tend to pose a lower risk to the insurer. Thus, the
                        premium
                        of a policy bought at a younger age is more affordable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gender-&nbsp;</strong>According to studies, it has been found that women generally outlive
                        men.
                        Moreover, as per statistical findings, it has been observed that women generally go to the doctor
                        more often
                        than men. Thus, these factors mark women as low-risk individuals, as a result of which they are
                        assigned a
                        lower premium.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical History (Self &amp; Family)-&nbsp;</strong>The medical history of an individual and
                        his/her
                        family is a significant factor which determines the premium amount of coverage policy. The premium
                        amount of
                        a policy depends on the severity of any past or current illnesses. For example, if an insurance
                        buyer proves
                        that he/she has totally recovered from a critical illness and is taking good care of his/her health
                        then the
                        insurer may charge a lower premium. However, the reduction of the premium rate depends on the
                        insurer and
                        type of life insurance policy an individual opts for. In certain cases, like cancer recovery, most
                        of the
                        companies do not offer a cover until the policy buyer proves that he/she has been in remission for a
                        minimum
                        of 5 years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marital Status-&nbsp;</strong>Marital status of an individual plays a vital role while
                        deciding the
                        premium amount and processing the insurance application. If couple buys a joint life insurance
                        policy, then
                        the premium of the policy will be higher as compared to the regular policy. It is important to keep
                        in mind
                        that in a joint plan the payout is given on a first death basis and there is no payout in case of
                        loss of
                        the second partner.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weight and Height-&nbsp;</strong>While determining the premium rate, the insurer considers
                        the
                        individual’s BMI (Body Mass Index). As obese people are more prone to suffer from weight-related
                        medical
                        problems, they will have to pay a higher premium on their indemnity policy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Occupation-&nbsp;</strong>The occupation of an individual plays a significant role in
                        determining
                        the premium of the policy. For instance, pilots, soldiers, individuals working in the mining
                        industry, oil
                        and gas plants, or any other dangerous profession have to pay a higher premium.</li>
                    <li><strong>Debts-&nbsp;</strong>Any unpaid debts, including mortgages, loans, credit card bills, etc.
                        are major
                        factors that determine the amount of protection one is offered.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drinking and Smoking</strong>- An individual will be classified as a smoker by the insurance
                        company
                        regardless of whether he/she is a light smoker or a heavy smoker. Thus, this results in a higher
                        premium
                        amount. Similarly, those who regularly consume alcohol can be subjected to an inflated premium,
                        because it
                        escalates the chances of alcohol-related health problems in an individual.</li>
                    <li><strong>International Travel-&nbsp;</strong>If the insurance buyer is a regular traveler and visits
                        places
                        that pose potential health risks, or have a high crime rate, or see regular acts of terror, s/he may
                        be
                        charged a higher premium. For instance, traveling to countries in Eastern and Southern Africa, where
                        a high
                        percentage of the population suffers from HIV, will likely result in a heavier premium than
                        travelling to
                        Norway.</li>

                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li><strong>Mortality Cost-&nbsp;</strong>Mortality cost is the amount paid by the insurer on policies.
                        The
                        insurance company considers the age of the applicant, health history (self and family), employment,
                        driving
                        records, hobbies, etc. while determining the premium amount for an individual.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operating Cost-&nbsp;</strong>The total operational cost that the insurer incurs towards
                        non-marketing and marketing expenses like rent, maintenance, legal fees, salaries, agents’
                        commission, etc.
                        affects the life insurance policy of an individual and how the premium is calculated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interest-&nbsp;</strong>In certain policies, the company invests the insured premiums in
                        real
                        estate, bonds, stocks, etc. under the assumption that the insured will earn a particular rate of
                        interest on
                        these investments. This interest-earning is another important factor while determining the premium
                        rate of a
                        life insurance plan.</li>

                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li><strong>Whole Life VS Term-&nbsp;</strong>As whole life insurance policies provide coverage until
                        death,
                        they generally charge higher premiums as compared to simple term plan that provide coverage only for
                        a fixed
                        number of years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decreasing Pay-outs-&nbsp;</strong>The life insurance premium calculation also depends upon
                        whether
                        an individual wants to have the extent of coverage decrease year after year, or s/he decides to have
                        a fixed
                        cover for the entire tenure of the policy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Covers-&nbsp;</strong>In case an individual opts for a joint life cover, then the premium
                        amount of
                        the policy tends to be higher, because the plan is more likely to see a claim at some point.
                        Moreover, a
                        policy that provides critical illness cover like heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, etc. will
                        also
                        charge high premium rates. The premium rates are expensive for individuals above 60 years of age or
                        those
                        suffering from any pre-existing diseases.</li>

                <h3><strong>Illustration of Calculation of Life Insurance Premium</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The calculations of premiums of life insurance are complex and cannot be done by
                    potential
                    consumers on their own because of several underlying factors. You can make use of a premium calculator
                    to
                    compute the coverage amount. This is explained with an example below:</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The premium calculator consists of various fields on the chosen plan. Below is the
                    example of
                    a New Endowment Plan:</p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li><strong>Type of the plan:</strong> New Endowment Plan</li>
                    <li><strong>Age of the policyholder:</strong> 38 years</li>
                    <li><strong>Term of the Plan:</strong> 20 years</li>
                    <li><strong>Sum assured:</strong> Rs. 10 lakhs</li>
                    <li><strong>Accident Rider/Benefit:</strong> Yes/Selected*</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraphBu">*The Accident Rider offers an additional cover for a death caused due to an accident
                    above
                    the base insurance plan, by summing up a small amount of the premiums on the base premiums. Other
                    insurance
                    companies may offer or may not offer the accident benefit rider.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The inferences drawn from this calculation are as under:</p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li><strong>Annual Premium:</strong> Rs. 49,940</li>
                    <li><strong>Semi-annual Premium:</strong> Rs. 25,235</li>
                    <li><strong>Quarterly Premium:</strong> Rs. 12,750</li>
                    <li><strong>Monthly Premium:</strong> Rs. 4,250</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The aforementioned figures of premiums are shown in four different types. Generally,
                    annual
                    premiums cost you lesser in the long-term choice for more frequent monthly, quarterly, and semi-annual
                    options.

                <h2>Term Life Insurance vs. Whole Life Insurance</h2>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Term Insurance differs from Whole Life Insurance in many ways. One must understand
                    these
                    plans carefully before buying one from insurance providers. Though both of these plans offer Life cover,
                    the
                    benefits the insured derives from them differ significantly. An individual’s life and finances can be
                    affected
                    if s/he chooses the wrong plan. To avoid any kind of inconvenience in the future, one can consult a
                    reputed
                    financial advisor and have a clear idea of which plan suits his/her needs.</p>

                <p class="paragraphBu">After carefully analyzing various aspects of both the aforementioned plans, one must
                    understand that each of these plans has its own benefits. The applicant can choose a combination of both
                    the
                    plans to avail the best protection for his/her life. Remember, one can buy both these plans depending on
                    his/her
                    financial status and future goals. In this manner, one can get the best of both the plans and offer
                    proper
                    protection for his/her immediate and long-term goals.</p>

                    term
                    insurance plan. A term plan should be the first scheme that one chooses, as the amount charged as
                    premium is
                    comparatively very low. Yet there is another benefit of buying a term insurance policy early and which
                    is that
                    the amount of premium will be fixed for the rest of the term of the policy.</p>

                    Thus, s/he
                    has to plan accordingly. Whole life insurance schemes offer the best savings along with safety for their
                    future.
                    The insured can continue with his/her existing term plan, if s/he already has one, and add a new Whole
                    life
                    indemnity as a supplement.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If one does not have an insurance plan and wishes to start investing in one, s/he can
                    opt for
                    combination of both the plans and divide his/her finances after consulting their insurance agent. It is
                    good to
                    buy a term policy and secure one’s family. Also, s/he has to pay lower premiums in comparison to other
                    life
                    insurance policies. Once this is done, s/he can focus on Whole Life plans and purchase multiple policies
                    with
                    different maturity dates. This will be a better way to organize significant financial assistance for

                <h2>Group Life Insurance</h2>
                <p class="paragraphBu">A group life insurance policy is provided by employers, business groups, banks, and

                    societies to help their employees, clients, and members.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The employer retains the policy contract and the insured employees receive a
                    certificate of
                    insurance coverage. On policy termination, the policyholder will need to present this certificate to the
                    concerned insurance company.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Breaking it Down Further</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Low Price</strong>- Employees have to pay a very low cost, sometimes no cost
                    at all,
                    to avail a group life insurance policy. Usually, the employer pays the premium as a welfare measure for
                    its
                    employees.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">When home loan providers or credit card companies provide group life insurance to
                    their
                    customers, the policyholders have to pay a premium but it is comparatively lower than that of an
                    individual
                    coverage.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>No Pre-Medical Tests Required</strong>- In most cases, a pre-medical check-up
                    is not
                    required for availing group life coverage. It can be a big advantage if a person is not able to avail a
                    personal
                    cover due to certain lifestyle habits and pre-existing health conditions. An individual life insurance
                    plan in
                    such situation will mean paying an exorbitant premium.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Easy Claim Process&nbsp;</strong>- In a group life insurance policy, the
                    claim
                    process is quite simple. The employees are automatically covered by a group life indemnity policy issued
                    by
                    their employer.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The employee only needs to accept the life insurance policy from the employer and get

                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Tax Saving</strong>- Both individual and group life insurance policies
                    provide tax
                    exemption benefits. In group life insurance, the employer purchases the group policy on behalf of the
                    employees,
                    therefore, the tax benefits will be provided to the employer in a group life plan.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><strong>How does a Group Life Insurance Plan work?<br> </strong></h3>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li>Usually, a group life insurance plan is more like a term plan. It implies that a fixed amount of sum
                        assured
                        or a life cover is provided in case the policyholder dies during the policy term. The sum assured is
                        not
                        refunded on the maturity of the policy.</li>
                    <li>A beneficiary can be nominated from the family who will get the sum assured in case of the
                        policyholder’s
                        death.</li>
                    <li>The sum assured is based on the individual’s salary package and varies from one company to another.
                        To
                        increase the sum assured, one will have to pay some extra premium.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><strong>How Long is a Group Life Insurance Policy Applicable for?</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The coverage is provided as long as a person is a part of that organization. When
                    they resign
                    or retire from that organization, they will have the option to convert the group life insurance plan
                    into an
                    individual plan.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">To do so, the certificate of coverage given by the employer must be presented to the
                    insurance provider.</p>

                <h2>Everything You Need To Know About Underwriting</h2>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Definition of Underwriting:</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">In simplest words,&nbsp;underwriting&nbsp;refers to the process followed by an
                    insurance
                    company wherein a designated individual analyzes the risk involved in insuring a potential insured
                    (customer).
                    In the evaluation process, the amount of coverage for the applicant, as well as the premium amount to be
                    paid by
                    her/him will be decided.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">So, while underwriting a prospective customer, the insurance underwriter aims to
                    protect the
                    insurer’s business if the customer appears to be too risky. Keeping this point in mind, one should
                    understand
                    that when a prospective customer comes at too high a risk to the insurance company, s/he may be denied
                    life
                    insurance.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Different Factors to Take into Account While Underwriting a Life Insurance
                        Policy:</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">There are a lot of factors that should be considered while underwriting a life
                    insurance
                    policy. Naturally, the first and foremost factor is the life expectancy of an applicant. If the
                    applicant leads
                    a healthy lifestyle, the insurer is more likely to approve his/her application. This is because such a
                    candidate
                    will give the insurer a chance to balance the sum assured offered with the total premiums paid by
                    him/her during
                    the tenure of the policy.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Besides the applicant’s life expectancy, insurers also analyze several other factors
                    that can
                    lead to the applicant’s early demise, such as one’s family history of medical ailments including stroke
                    or
                    cancer, her/his occupation, etc.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Below we’ve enlisted some other criteria that influence one’s risk
                        assessment:<br>
                    </strong></p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li><strong>Age of the applicant:</strong>Individuals who are still under or in their thirties are
                        considered
                        low-risk applicants and, hence, may qualify for affordable life insurance policies with low premium
                        rates.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Gender of the applicant:</strong>As per scientific research, it has been found that women
                        have
                        longer life expectancy as compared to men; hence, their chances of getting an affordable policy is
                        higher.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Personal as well as family health history:</strong>If someone in your family suffers (or has
                        suffered) from serious ailments such as cancer or heart problems, then you will also be considered
                        as a
                        high-risk applicant. Additionally, if you have gone through some serious surgeries in the past or if
                        you
                        regularly fall ill, your application might be rejected by underwriters on the ground of higher risk
                        involvement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Number of dependents:</strong>If the applicant is married and has children, chances are s/he
                        will be
                        offered family floater plans, wherein one can avail a lower premium amount.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smoking Habits:</strong>If the applicant happens to be a smoker, the premium rates for her
                        or him
                        can increase by 100%.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nature of the applicant’s job:</strong>In case the applicant’s occupation requires him/her
                        to
                        regularly be in a hazardous environment or situation, such as fire-fighting, mining, etc.,
                        underwriters will
                        regard his/her case as high-risk and hence s/he may be granted the life insurance policy at a very
                        high
                        premium rate, or in the worst case scenario, s/he might be denied the insurance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Thus, one can conclude that there are dozens of factors that determine if the
                    underwriters
                    will approve one’s application or not. Knowing these factors can help individuals assess their risk and
                    accordingly estimate their premium.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>What should a High-Risk Applicant do?</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Due to many factors contributing to the approval of one’s application, there is
                    always a
                    possibility of people falling into the high-risk category. Such individuals either have their
                    applications
                    rejected or end up paying high premiums.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Thankfully, there is an abundance of middle life insurance companies that
                    specifically focus
                    on high-risk applicants. These companies not only offer the best life insurance policies at affordable
                    rates but
                    also have a wider range of experience when it comes to dealing with high-risk applicants.</p>

                <h3><strong>The Purpose of an NRI Life Insurance Plan</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">For a Non-Resident Indian, whose spouse, children and parents live in India, a
                    perfect NRI
                    plan must offer the following features:</p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li><strong>Guaranteed Income</strong>- It must offer guaranteed income at regular intervals for the
                        dependents.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wealth maximization-</strong>It must offer wealth maximization to the policyholder and

                        spouse to help them accomplish their financial goals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Children’s Education</strong>- It must offer a benefit that can be used to meet the
                        children’s
                        educational expenses.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Generally, a best life insurance plan is clubbed with a child plan to take care of
                    the
                    educational expenses of the insured’s children. In case the policyholder passes away, his/her children
                    get a
                    lump sum benefit and the future insurance premium is taken care of by the insurer.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Payment Mode</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">All individuals of Indian origin, regardless of their citizenship status, are
                    eligible to buy
                    life insurance plan in India. While an buyer can purchase life insurance in India from another country
                    without
                    any issues, additional expenses can be incurred by him/her. For NRIs, the cost conducting medical
                    screening and
                    sending the reports to the insured is not covered. The premium can be paid through the following modes:

                <h3><strong>When to Buy NRI Life Insurance?</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Before an NRI gets insurance, he/she must have a fixed income source. While buying
                    insurance
                    at a young age is easy and hassle-free, if an NRI doesn’t act as an early bird and develops a
                    pre-existing
                    illness at the time of buying an NRI plan, he/she will have to pay an enhanced premium.</p>
                <h3><strong>From Where to Get NRI Insurance?</strong></h3>
                <p class="paragraphBu">From where should an NRI get insurance (i.e. from his country of residence or country
                    of
                    origin) is a debatable middleic. Before an NRI makes up his mind, he/she should keep the following
                    factors in
                    mind.</p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li><strong>Cost Variation-&nbsp;</strong>Insurance premium might vary from one country to the other.
                        How
                        economical it is to buy life insurance in India or the country of residence, depends upon the
                        company.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tax</strong><strong>Benefit Variation-</strong>&nbsp;Taxation policies vary from one country
                        to the
                        other. For instance, in India, the total income from life insurance policies is tax-free, regardless
                        of
                        whether it is a death benefit or maturity benefit. In the USA, the principal amount is tax-free but
                        the
                        earned interest taxable.</li>

                <h2>What is the Procedure for Cancelling a Life Insurance Policy?</h2>
                <p class="paragraphBu">There can be a number of reasons to cancel a life insurance plan. The reason could be
                    a
                    financial crisis or an urgent need for money. One can have any number of reasons, but irrespective of
                    any
                    reason, it is fairly easy to cancel a plan. The following the process is a guide to this procedure:</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Visit the official website of the insurance company from where the life insurance
                    policy was
                    bought.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Irrespective of the fact that whether the life insurance is from a large national
                    company or
                    some regional insurance provider, visit the provider’s official website in order to check the
                    cancellation
                    procedure. The website address can be found on any of the correspondence pieces received from the
                    insurance
                    provider. Also, look for the website on the internet using the name of the insurance provider.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Getting in touch with a Broker</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Before proceeding with the life insurance policy cancellation, it is suggested to get
                    hold of
                    an experienced broker to clear all the doubts and check whether this is the right decision. It will help
                    one in
                    understanding whether this will reap good results.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Getting hold of an Accountant</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Canceling a life insurance policy can leave a door open for taxes implications.
                    Excess
                    premiums and earnings assist in building a financial corpus for whole life policies. When one cancels a
                    policy,
                    the insurance provider sends them a cheque with a certain amount. This sum may or may not be eligible
                    for tax
                    exemptions. Hence, it is necessary to consult a seasoned tax guru as she/he can resolve all the queries
                    about
                    tax implications linked to the cancellation of a life insurance scheme.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Take partial withdrawal plans into consideration</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If it is a universal life insurance policy, then partial withdrawal of sum assured is
                    allowed
                    without complete cancellation of the policy. With partial withdrawal, the policy will free up a certain
                    sum of
                    money that can be used immediately, and in the meantime, some money can still be left in the policy to
                    cover the
                    insured’s family. Nevertheless, a partial withdrawal is like taking a loan against a policy and can have
                    certain
                    consequences.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Steps Involved:</p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li>The policyholder should get in touch with the life insurance company and request for policy
                        cancellation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Typically, the company will offer various alternatives &amp; insurance solutions to the
                        policyholder.</li>
                    <li>In case the policyholder is happy with offered alternatives, he/she won’t have to cancel the policy.
                    </li>
                    <li>In case the policyholder wants to cancel the life insurance plan anyway, he/she needs to download
                        the plan
                        cancellation form the official website of the insurance provider.</li>
                    <li>The policyholder must duly fill the policy cancellation form and attach/upload the required
                        documents (if
                        any).</li>
                    <li>The company will initiate the policy cancellation process.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Note-&nbsp;</strong>The policyholder isn’t entitled to any refunds if he/she
                    cancels
                    the plan after the cooling-off period.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Reason for Cancellation</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Before a policyholder proceeds to cancel his/her life insurance plan, he/she must
                    analyze the
                    reason behind this cancellation. The decision to cancel a life insurance plan is a major one. When a
                    plan is
                    canceled, the insured loses the insurance coverage.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">If a policyholder decides to cancel his/her plan because he/she has come across a
                    better
                    plan, this can be considered as a valid reason for cancellation.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Cancellation Refund</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Every best life insurance plan comes with a grace period/cool-off period which
                    enables the
                    policyholder to assess his/her insurance expectations. It gives him/her the time to make sure that the
                    insurance
                    plan&nbsp;is the best for him/her. In case a policyholder cancels his/her policy during the grace
                    period, he/she
                    will be offered a refund. Also, she/he won’t have to pay any additional fee.</p>

                <h2>Impact of GST on Life Insurance</h2>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The Goods and Services Tax (GST) was slated to influence the prices of almost all the
                    consumer products and services offered. GST was claimed to be the greatest indirect tax reform in India
                    since
                    independence. It was expected to have a positive impact on the Indian economy.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The service sector, at present, comprises 60% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
                    Taking
                    this into consideration, the GST was likely to have a huge impact on the service sector. The life
                    insurance
                    industry also forms a part of the service sector, which, consequently, got greatly affected by the GST.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Life insurance is a sector which has a vast potential in the country due to the
                    fiscal
                    cushion that it offers to the people for taking care of their needs and requirements at various stages
                    of life.
                    Nevertheless, life insurance, at present, sees a very low penetration in the country. Taking this into
                    consideration, it could be advantageous to not only create awareness but also boost its coverage and
                    reach.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Life insurance services were taxed between the range of 1.5% and 15% before the
                    implementation of GST. The rate of service tax that was applicable then was decided based on the type of
                    the
                    policy. In December 2015, Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR) report was published by the Chief Economic. This
                    report was
                    on GST Laws, according to which, a standard GST rate of 18% was decided for the insurance services.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The burden of indirect taxes was passed on to the end customer; the augmented 18% tax
                    rate
                    under the GST was likely to make life insurance policies more unreachable to a larger chunk of
                    customers, which
                    in turn, lowered the level of insurance penetration in India. Despite this, now the insurance
                    penetration has
                    witnessed a growth of 8% (CAGR) approximately.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">In comparison to countries like Australia, Malaysia, Africa, Singapore, etc. where
                    the
                    government provides the life insurance benefit as a part of social security, imposing taxes on the
                    insurance
                    products and services deters many people from considering buying life cover for themselves and their
                    dependents.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraphBu"><strong>The Relationship between the Life Insurance Business and GST:</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The premiums of life insurance policy represent two most important components,
                    namely, risk
                    coverage and savings. The service tax was imposed only on the premium component.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">As per the rules of GST, the value of services on which the GST is imposed regarding
                    life
                    insurance industry shall be according to the following:</p>
                <ul class="data_ul">
                    <li>The gross premium is reduced by the allocated amount for savings or investments on behalf of the
                        policyholder.</li>
                    <li>When single premium annual policies are taken into consideration, the insured will be charged 10% of
                        the
                        single premium.</li>
                    <li>In other cases, 25% of the premiums for the first year of the policy and 12.5% of the premiums in
                        the
                        forthcoming years will be imposed. For instance, if the premium of an endowment plan is Rs. 100,
                        then the
                        18% GST would be imposed on the 25% of the premiums (which will be Rs. 25) the GST will be Rs. 4.50.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the total premiums paid by the insured are towards the risk cover of life insurance, only 18% GST
                        would
                        be imposed on total premium.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraphBu">Due to the increase in the percentage of GST, the overall impact of GST is the
                    increased
                    expenditure (premium + increased GST), when it comes to endowment plans and term life insurance.</p>
                <p class="paragraphBu">The insured stands a chance to avail the benefits if the insurance companies get a
                    green
                    signal on the input tax credit benefit. Before the implementation of GST, it was unclear, since the
                    centre/state
                    GST structure was very complex. However, after the implementation of GST, the new and existing insurance
                    customers had to bear the updated price.</p>
