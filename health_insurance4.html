                    <p>A fine day on your office couch, with deadlines to meet you know that you are fine-up on
                        the corporate ladder, but the
                        one thing that’s bugging you is the uncanny back pain.</p>
                    <p>You go to a doctor only to find that the diagnostic procedures cost you a handsome amount
                        of money at the end of the
                        day.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The money that you so wanted to spend on new furniture, maybe got completely exhausted in
                    paying up the hospital
                    bills.
                    If this is the scenario for normal diagnosis, imagine how high the amount might go for
                    hospitalization for about a
                    week?</p>
                <h4 class="subheading">Are you afraid now thinking about how easily you can end up your
                    hard-earned money in a situation that could have been
                    avoided?</h4>
                <p>The busy and hectic schedules of our daily life, from meeting regular deadlines to the
                    pressure of fine performance in
                    the field to being over-burdened because your kid hasn’t been eating his/her cereals
                    properly seldom leads us to ignore
                    our much precious health.</p>

                <p>Even if we set targets of hitting the gym or running an extra mile, we end up getting caught
                    up in our daily chores.</p>

                <h4>But does that mean we have to go on with the risk like forever?</h4>
                <br>
                <p>The answer to it is a big no.</p>
                <p>One can easily avoid the risk by opting for health insurance and cover future hazards.</p>
                <p>But we do know that you might have sometimes thought of signing up for a health insurance
                    policy but the complexities of
                    which is the best one to choose and what benefits they do really scare you.</p>

                    <p>It assures you that even if you are down with an illness, or injured you would not be
                        down with financial needs. It
                        gives you a shield or blanket protection that when your health needs the care and

                <p>An accident or an unforeseen illness doesn’t come knocking your door. So, health insurance

                    unwelcome guests.</p>
                <p>It is generally considered that the better prepared you are for risk, the better are your

                        <h4 class="subheading1">
                            Answer- No, corporate employers cover you only till the time you are on board with them, when
                            you lose a job your
                            medi-claim gets scraped away automatically. This exposes you to a threat till the time you join
                            another corporate firm.
