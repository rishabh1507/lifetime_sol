                                    Answer- No, health insurance provides you a 360-degree coverage if anything happens to
                                    you from ambulance to OPD to what not but medi-claim gives you limited coverage which is

                                    Answer- For e.g.Corporate covers, their employees for an amount up to INR 4 Lac, surpassing this amount limit would

                                    Answer- No, corporate employers cover you only till the time you are on board with them, when you lose a job your
                                    medi-claim gets scraped away automatically. This exposes you to a threat till the time you join another corporate firm.
