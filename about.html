                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lifetime SOLUTIONS established in 2004 hails its roots from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. It is a pioneer financial advisory
                        firm with a sprawling client base of 1000 plus people who have entrusted LTS with the responsibility to ease their
                        burden of financial planning.
                        
                        As it’s said, “With greater responsibility comes great ability”, and rightly so we are constantly enhancing and evolving
                        ourselves to be of service to people.
                        
                        From a home-maker who may wish to save in tiny bits to a corporate persona, smart financial planning can never be out of
                        the trend. We save for significant life events, contingencies, and future plans.
                        But quite frankly, even though we realize the power of compounding that smart investment decision brings upon us, we are
                        often baffled with the right investment choice.
                        
                        And here comes Lifetime SOLUTIONS- saving the day. We have a curated panel of financial expertise that has a profound
                        understanding of the market, with forecasts that match your investment appetite.
                        
                        Each person has a different perspective and dream of a golden future. And this stark difference in goals is very well
                        understood by us. We respect individual needs and targets.
                        
                        We at Lifetime SOLUTIONS believe that the perfect investment option cannot be ruled out by a software bot but be
                        custom-tailored suiting individual aspirations.
                        
                        So, keeping that point in mind, we at LTS have not only made our customers more aware and informed about investment
                        options but have also bridged the gap of making individualized financial portfolios.
                        
                        What we have realized as a customer pain-point is that any agent or a company executive has certain constraints while
                        advising on financial decisions, because of the obligations that bind him to the firm. And this results in a biased
                        decision which may lead to loss of hard-earned money.
                        
                        So, as a way to relieve customers of the hassles of biased financial advice, we stand to offer independent analysis. Our
                        expertise, unbiased from their head and heart offers you the best alternate options to select from.
                        
                        If you are a beginner in investment decisions, you will feel confident to have us by your side. And if you are a
                        corporate persona, who wants to invest in the right opportunistic moment but have a constraint of time, we are in your
                        service by getting you updated with the most relevant information.
                        
                        And that is all about your financial well-wisher, your guide- Lifetime SOLUTIONS.

                    <p>
                        Imagine a kid who is having trouble solving maths problems in his class, but he wants to top his maths paper. What does
                        he do?<br>
                        
                        He may go to someone whom he trusts and feels would aid him in his struggle.<br>
                        
                        In the same way, when you are stuck with managing your financial portfolio, Lifetime SOLUTIONS comes to your rescue.<br>
                        
                        Investment is smarter than just saving up your coins, but as lucrative the returns of investment might seem, it incurs a
                        bit of risk too if you aren’t aware and informed about the market.<br>
                        
                        So, bridging the gap and bringing you more closer to your dream is what LTS stands to offer you. And that is exactly why

                    <h2>FINANCIAL PLANNING</h2>
                    <p>It is generally regarded that, to achieve great things you need great plans. If you are pondering-how is it so?</p>
                    <p>It is because with a great plan, comes the great discipline to execute a work or achieve a goal strategically.</p>
                    <p>Saying so, as you start earning money it’s imperative that you have a proper financial plan at hand.</p>
                    <p>Financial planning deals with creating a financial plan, chalking out all the current monetary balance at disposal, then
                    liabilities or obligations to be fulfilled, and ultimately individual goals and targets.</p>
                    <p>Based on these, a financial plan is formulated that have the strategies and required steps needed to fulfill the goals.</p>
                    <p>One of the best things about the financial plan is that it sets realistic boundaries keeping external market factors in
                    mind.</p>
                    <p>A financial plan can be done individually with a lot of sustained efforts or can be given to a financial advisor.</p>
                    <p>With a professional financial advisor in help, you wouldn’t need to worry about the hassles of setting realistic
                    investment plans. All would be taken care of when you enjoy your time. As a financial advisor and planner like Lifetime
                    SOLUTIONS take into account the different needs of people and chalk out the best plan.</p>

                    <p><strong>To let you know, more about financial planning, let us go through the key-pointers first:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        <h2>Wealth Creation</h2>
                        <p>It is the kind of plan that enables an investor to seize the right opportunity by generating wealth that makes him/her
                        not only sustain life but also make him capable to afford aspirations.</p>
                        <p>Under this comes the ULIP plan which offers an individual the flexibility of investment plan added with the guarantee of
                        protection. Here, the cash value varies with the net asset value of the underlying investment assets.
                        <br>And so is regarded as a smart investment option by many.
                        </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Child Education Planning</h2>
                            <p>Your child means so much to you, securing their future covering all they may ever need in your absence is one of the
                            best assurance out there in the market as a parent.</p>
                            <p>Education is everything that can make your child’s future sparkle diamonds and jewels. And when the importance of good
                            education cannot be stressed upon, its also a harsh reality that the cost of quality education in India has been rising
                            exponentially.</p>
                            <p>So, the best way to deal with this issue is to have the right planning from the right time which this policy plan
                            attempts to offer.</p>
                            <p>From right after a child is born till he/she attains maturity, this policy plan aims to secure your child’s future. Some
                            policy plans under this, do allow withdrawal of a certain amount in the middle of the tenure.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Retirement Plan</h2>
                            <p>Retirement can be tough if not planned well-ahead the time, coupled with that comes the overarching factors of health
                            care, reduced earnings, and inflation as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>To ease all that up, life insurance provides you with the right peace of mind that you need post-retirement through this
                            policy plan. While we have no hand in regulating external factors like cost and economy we do have in our hands the
                            power of planning.</p>
                            <p>They give you the much-needed confidence boost in your late 60s by providing you with a retirement corpus that intends
                            to generate regular income post-retirement.
                            </p>
                            <p>Also, the right plan may save your post-retirement plans and may give you the desire to savior your golden days with
                            your grandchild, which is why this plan cannot be ignored.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Home Loan</h2>
                            <p>A dream house is a goal of many. But, as nothing happens in a click, similarly so you need sustained financial planning
                            to make your dream come true.</p>
                            <p>Helping you realize your dream, may come easy with a home loan at the rescue.
                            Generally, a home loan is taken to purchase residential property.

                            <p>In India, there are financial institutions which provide home loan up to 80-85% of the market value of that property.</p>
                            <p>The interest rate vary in this type of loan, which can be- fixed, floating, or hybrid.</p>

                    investment options.<br>

                    give you the right amount of exposure you need to make a really smart decision ahead.<br>
                    
                    <strong>We deal with the following category of investment opportunities</strong>

                        <li>

                            <p>
                                (Lump-sum investment): Mutual Fund is nothing but a fund generated by pooling out investment from individual investors.
                                This fund is then managed by a professional who has a very sound knowledge about the market who attempts to generate
                                higher returns with lower investment.<br>
                                We often want our money to be taken care of, by professionals but also lack the huge amount of investment required to
                                hire such market experts. Mutual funds let you get the best expertise even with a limited investment.<br>
                                
                                To understand this better, let us take an example of a shared car ride.<br>
                                Suppose you and your friends decide to visit Lonavala and so decide to hire a cab service which comes with a driver as
                                none of you know how to drive a car. The driver being the expert knows different routes to the destination.<br>
                                
                                Now some routes might be short but may make the car take a lot of turns while some route might take a long time but
                                would make you reach your destination straight.<br>
                                
                                Now, the decision of which route to take and which not is decided by you.<br>
                                
                                Like in the car, you and your friends had a common destination, in the same way, individual investors with the same
                                investment objective get clubbed together.<br>
                                
                                The driver with the knowledge of the route and associated conditions is similar to the market expert who takes care of
                                your money.<br>
                                
                                So, yes the journey for a mutual fund investment is this easy.<br>

                                A deposit can be made generally by virtue of two types of account, namely-<br>
                                Fixed Deposit (FD): Fixed deposits are commonly referred to as term deposits. Under FD, an individual investor may

                                    So, out of the income, you want to save a certain fixed amount of money say INR 1000 per month in the bank but with the

                                    From re-construction to repair activities, a number of things can be done under fire insurance depending upon the policy
                                    plan coverage.<br>
                                    
                                    In India, there are fifteen different kinds of fire insurances, that you can choose from depending upon your needs.<br>

                                </p>
                                <li>Motor Insurance</li>
                                <p>It is one of the most significant general insurance. Suppose, you own a vehicle that can be a car, two-wheeler, or a
                                truck or anything, and accidentally it faces an accident.<br>
                                So, in situations like this, it not only protects you from financial drainage but also offers third party coverage, in
                                cases where there is a loss involved in the third party and you have an obligation.<br>
                                As it is also mandatory by law in the case of four-wheelers, it is affordable protection without much strain in your
                                pocket.
                                </p>
                                <li>Marine Insurance</li>
                                <p>
                                    A sea with its furious and turbulent waves is as much unpredictable as a road.<br>
                                    So, in order to protect ships, cargoes, and terminals from losses during the voyage, marine insurance is of pivotal
                                    importance.<br>
                                </p>
                                <li>Accident and other miscellaneous non-life insurance</li>
                                <p>
                                    It covers other remaining fields that aren’t insured by other
                                    policies.<br>
                                    It can be from accident to anything at all.<br>
                                </p>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>BASIC DEFINITIONS</h2>
                            <li>
                            <p>
                                Debt: Let’s understand debt in a very simple language.<br>
                                
                                Suppose you and your friend go to a coffee shop and you people want to try the new chocolate tart. But, unfortunately,
                                you have forgotten your wallet at the coffee place.<br>
                                
                                But, your friend comes to your rescue and offers to pay for the tart and says that you can pay the amount later.<br>
                                
                                So, the amount that you owe to your friend is nothing but debt.<br>
                                In the language of finance, debt is what you owe, you being the debtor and the person to whom you owe the money being
                                the creditor.<br>
                            </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <p>
                                Equity: In finance, equity is nothing but ownership of assets that may have associated debts or other liabilities
                                attached to it.<br>
                            
                                Suppose, you decide to open up a store of fresh organic vegetables and for which you need to procure a room in a
                                mall.<br>
                            
                                Now, after you gain the ownership, you come to know that the place comes with certain rent from the mall and unpaid
                                loan
                                amount. This is the debt or liability associated with the asset that you're beholding.<br>
