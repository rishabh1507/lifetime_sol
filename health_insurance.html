                    <h2>Health Insurance</h2>
                    <p>Health Insurance is a type of insurance that offers financial coverage for medical expenses, in
                        case of a
                        medical
                        emergency. A health insurance plan provides insurance coverage to the insured with multiple
                        benefits,
                        including cashless
                        hospitalization, day-care facility &amp; coverage for terminal &amp; critical illness etc.</p>
                    <h2><strong>What is a Health Insurance Policy?</strong></h2>
                    <p>A health insurance policy is a contract between the insurer and policyholder in which insurance
                        company
                        provides
                        financial coverage for medical expenses incurred by the insured. A health policy provides
                        benefit of
                        reimbursement of
                        medical expenses or cashless treatment mentioned in the health policy.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the medical coverage, Health Insurance plans also offer tax benefits under section 80D
                        of the
                        Income Tax Act,
                        1961.</p>
                    <p>Medical expenses are sky-rocketing, where even a single hospitalization is enough to wipe off
                        your
                        lifetime savings.
                        With a cashless facility, keep your savings intact with best health insurance plans from
                        different
                        insurance providers.

                    <h2><strong>Key Benefits of Health Insurance Plans in India</strong></h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of healthcare in the modern days is increasing at a crazy
                        rate
                        while one’s
                        earnings do not seem to match up that level. A patient looking forward to availing frequent
                        health
                        check-ups may
                        no longer be able to bear the associated expenses. Comprehensive health insurance plans come
                        packed with
                        features that can assist a person in managing expenses associated with medical emergencies and
                        also with
                        preventive healthcare check-ups. Some health insurance plans also offer add-on cover for OPD
                        expenses.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Following are the key benefits of a health insurance policy that one can consider:</strong>

                            <p>Every medical insurance company has tie-ups with various nursing homes and hospitals
                                across the
                                country
                                called 'empanelled hospitals'. If you are admitted to one of these, you don’t need to
                                pay
                                anything. You
                                only need to mention your policy number and everything else will be taken care of by the
                                hospital and
                                your insurer.</p>
                            <p>These types of health insurance plans are preferred because there is no stress of claim
                                reimbursement and
                                documentation. However, if your expenses go beyond the sub-limits specified by the
                                insurance
                                cover or
                                marked as not covered by the provider, then you will have to settle it directly with the
                                hospital.
                                Another important thing to remember is that cashless mediclaim is not available if one
                                gets
