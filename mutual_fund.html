                <h2>Mutual Funds</h2>
                <h2>What are mutual funds?</h2>
                <p>A mutual fund is a company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in securities
                    such as stocks,
                    bonds, and short-term debt. The combined holdings of the mutual fund are known as its portfolio.
                    Investors buy shares in
                    mutual funds. Each share represents an investor’s part ownership in the fund and the income it
                    generates.</p>

                <h2>Why do people buy mutual funds?
                    What types of mutual funds are there?
                    What are the benefits and risks of mutual funds?
                    How to buy and sell mutual funds
                    Understanding fees
                    Avoiding fraud
                    Additional information</h2>

                <h2>Why do people buy mutual funds?</h2>
                <p>Mutual funds are a popular choice among investors because they generally offer the following
                    features:

                    Professional Management. The fund managers do the research for you. They select the securities and
                    monitor the
                    performance.
                    Diversification or “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” Mutual funds typically invest in a range
                    of companies and
                    industries. This helps to lower your risk if one company fails.
                    Affordability. Most mutual funds set a relatively low dollar amount for initial investment and
                    subsequent purchases.
                    Liquidity. Mutual fund investors can easily redeem their shares at any time, for the current net
                    asset value (NAV) plus
                    any redemption fees.
                    What types of mutual funds are there?
                    Most mutual funds fall into one of four main categories – money market funds, bond funds, stock
                    funds, and target date
                    funds. Each type has different features, risks, and rewards.

                    Money market funds have relatively low risks. By law, they can invest only in certain high-quality,
                    short-term
                    investments issued by U.S. corporations, and federal, state and local governments.
                    Bond funds have higher risks than money market funds because they typically aim to produce higher
                    returns. Because there
                    are many different types of bonds, the risks and rewards of bond funds can vary dramatically.
                    Stock funds invest in corporate stocks. Not all stock funds are the same. Some examples are:
                    Growth funds focus on stocks that may not pay a regular dividend but have potential for
                    above-average financial gains.
                    Income funds invest in stocks that pay regular dividends.
                    Index funds track a particular market index such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
                    Sector funds specialize in a particular industry segment.
                    Target date funds hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments. Over time, the mix gradually
                    shifts according to
                    the fund’s strategy. Target date funds, sometimes known as lifecycle funds, are designed for
                    individuals with particular
                    retirement dates in mind.</p>

                <h2>What are the benefits and risks of mutual funds?
                    Mutual funds offer professional investment management and potential diversification. They also offer
                    three ways to earn
                    money:</h2>

                <p>Dividend Payments. A fund may earn income from dividends on stock or interest on bonds. The fund then
                    pays the
                    shareholders nearly all the income, less expenses.
                    Capital Gains Distributions. The price of the securities in a fund may increase. When a fund sells a
                    security that has
                    increased in price, the fund has a capital gain. At the end of the year, the fund distributes these
                    capital gains, minus
                    any capital losses, to investors.
                    Increased NAV. If the market value of a fund’s portfolio increases, after deducting expenses, then
                    the value of the fund
                    and its shares increases. The higher NAV reflects the higher value of your investment.
                    All funds carry some level of risk. With mutual funds, you may lose some or all of the money you
                    invest because the
                    securities held by a fund can go down in value. Dividends or interest payments may also change as
                    market conditions
                    change.</p>

                <p>A fund’s past performance is not as important as you might think because past performance does not
                    predict future
                    returns. But past performance can tell you how volatile or stable a fund has been over a period of
                    time. The more
                    volatile the fund, the higher the investment risk.</p>

                <h2>How to buy and sell mutual funds</h2>

                <p>Investors buy mutual fund shares from the fund itself or through a broker for the fund, rather than
                    from other
                    investors. The price that investors pay for the mutual fund is the fund’s per share net asset value
                    plus any fees
                    charged at the time of purchase, such as sales loads.

                    Mutual fund shares are “redeemable,” meaning investors can sell the shares back to the fund at any
                    time. The fund
                    usually must send you the payment within seven days.

                    Before buying shares in a mutual fund, read the prospectus carefully. The prospectus contains
                    information about the
                    mutual fund’s investment objectives, risks, performance, and expenses. See How to Read a Mutual Fund
                    Prospectus Part 1,
                    Part 2, and Part 3 to learn more about key information in a prospectus.

                    Understanding fees
                    As with any business, running a mutual fund involves costs. Funds pass along these costs to
                    investors by charging fees
                    and expenses. Fees and expenses vary from fund to fund. A fund with high costs must perform better
                    than a low-cost fund
                    to generate the same returns for you.</p>

                <p>Even small differences in fees can mean large differences in returns over time. For example, if you
                    invested $10,000 in
                    a fund with a 10% annual return, and annual operating expenses of 1.5%, after 20 years you would
                    have roughly $49,725.
                    If you invested in a fund with the same performance and expenses of 0.5%, after 20 years you would
                    end up with $60,858.

                    It takes only minutes to use a mutual fund cost calculator to compute how the costs of different
                    mutual funds add up
                    over time and eat into your returns. See the Mutual Fund Glossary for types of fees.

                    Avoiding fraud
                    By law, each mutual fund is required to file a prospectus and regular shareholder reports with the
                    SEC. Before you
                    invest, be sure to read the prospectus and the required shareholder reports. Additionally, the
                    investment portfolios of
                    mutual funds are managed by separate entities know as “investment advisers” that are registered with
                    the SEC. Always
                    check that the investment adviser is registered before investing.</p>
