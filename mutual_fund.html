                <h3><strong>Have you ever decided what has been more exciting down the lane- the first job letter that made your eyes shed a tear or
                the first time you laid your hand in your much-longed salary?</strong><br>
                <br>
                <strong>All those tedious hours of lab, assignments, tests would have made so much sense to you on that day. After all, becoming
                economically independent is a huge leap we all want to place ourselves into.</strong><br>
                <br></h3>
                <h2>But with time did the excitement of waiting for the salary day fade away?</h2>

                <h3>With you realizing that your offer letter was just the beginning of everything that you had to spend upon, with you
                getting a deducted amount from the HR, huge and piled up bills, necessities that you can’t ignore and also the EMI for
                that trendy couch you fancied buying, then you also have to pay your maid without whom you would have completely
                survived on Maggi.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Now after all these, you know you are not left with a very handsome amount to go for a trip to goa or buy the gadget you
                wanted so dearly.</h3>

                <h2>So, what can you do?</h2>
                <p>Well, nothing to worry from now as you have crossed your road with Lifetime SOLUTIONS. From giving you ideas of smart
                investment to planning your growth cycle, we will do everything that is with us for your sound financial health.<br>
                <br>
                Today's world runs on smart work rather than hard work, keeping that in mind we will chalk out a track that would yield
                you your bucket list with minimum hassles.<br>
                <br>
                To begin with, it’s imperative to know that right now the Indian market is on a growing stage, even with volatility it
                has the scope to rise exponentially.<br>
                <br>
                Under such market circumstances, the finest way of investing is through a mutual fund. We have all our life heard so
                much about how it may be subjected to market risk but very few of us have given it a serious thought.<br>
                <br>
                Sometimes it's because we have been told to choose the traditional RD/FD funds by our parents, or are unwilling to come
                out of our comfort zone and do something that would make our dreams come true.<br>
                <br>
                And that is why now is the time to buckle up your socks and plan for a sustainable future where you will not only save
                but also grow exponentially to take that extra leap of switching to business class seats from economy travels and make
                your family proud.<br>
                <br>
                Remember with a little risk comes higher reward. We will ease up the journey for you by simplifying each step so that
                you can make a more informed and conscious decision.<br>

                <h2>What is a Mutual Fund?</h2>
                
                <p>Mutual Fund is nothing but a fund generated by pooling out investment from individual investors. This fund is then
                managed by a professional who has a very sound knowledge about the market who attempts to generate higher returns with
                lower investment.<br>
                <br>
                We often want our money to be taken care of, by professionals but also lack the huge amount of investment required to
                hire such market experts. Mutual funds let you get the best expertise even with a limited investment.<br>
                <br>
                To understand this better, let us take an example of a shared car ride.<br>
                <br>
                Suppose you and your friends decide to visit Lonavala and so decide to hire a cab service which comes with a driver as
                none of you know how to drive a car. The driver being the expert knows different routes to the destination.<br>
                <br>
                Now some routes might be short but may make the car take a lot of turns while some route might take a long time but
                would make you reach your destination straight.<br>
                <br>
                Now, the decision of which route to take and which not is decided by you.<br>
                <br>
                Like in the car, you and your friends had a common destination, in the same way, individual investors with the same
                investment objective get clubbed together.<br>
                <br>
                The driver with the knowledge of the route and associated conditions is similar to the market expert who takes care of
                your money.<br>
                <br>
                So, yes the journey for a mutual fund investment is this easy.<br>
                <br>
                But now you may have a question of what are the different types of mutual funds available in the market for you to
                choose from?<br>
                <br>
                A point to be noted here is that mutual funds provide you with the scope to choose on the type of fund that you want to
                invest in depending upon your objective and risk appetite.<br>
                <br>
                You may have a short term goal to achieve or may want to invest for a longer period. All of it depends on you to select
                from.<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h2>So, now that you know that the choice is all yours, let's have a look into the types of mutual funds available in the
            Indian market:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Equity Mutual Fund</h2>
                    <p>Equity Mutual Fund These kinds of funds are best if you have a high-risk appetite and want a higher return on your
                    investment. There are 10 different equity mutualfunds as recognized by SEBI. You can easily invest directly in stocks under these funds. It is generally recommended
                    that if you want to invest for higher returns as permitted under these funds, it is imperative to be far-sighted and
                    invest for a longer period.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Debt Mutual Fund</h2>
                    <p>They are safer in terms of risk as compared to equity mutual funds. Even though they don't incur
                    higher returns like equity funds they will give you modest returns. They are an excellent investment option if you are
                    looking for a shorter window of investment. There are 16 sub-categories of debt mutual funds.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Hybrid Mutual Fund</h2>
                    <p>These schemes are a mix of debt and equity models. It's important to note that the return and risk
                    are inversely proportional to each other. So you may choose wisely depending upon the amount of risk you are willing to
                    face.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Solution-oriented Mutual Fund</h2>
                    <p>These schemes come with a mandatory lock-in period for 5 years. These schemes try to
                    ease you up with a plan like retirement or saving for your child's education.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Now, these are the different fund categories in which you can choose to invest. Looking further, a mutual fund can be:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Open-Ended</h2>
                    <p>Under the open-ended scheme, there can be an unlimited number of shares issued which can be regularly
                    evaluated through Net Asset Value.</p>
                    <h2>Close-Ended</h2>
                    <p>In the closed-end scheme, there is a specific number of shares through which the mutual fund is
                    launched. And these schemes are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end, here the professional manager does not
                    require to procure new shares to meet the demands of the investors.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When we talk about mutual funds, one of the most common terms that keep swinging to and fro is NAV which is Net
                Asset
                Value.</h3>

                <h2>What is NAV(Net Asset Value)?</h2>
                <p>You know that each and everything you buy cost you something.<br>
                <br>
                Like if you go grocery shopping you may want 1 kg flour, 500 ml milk all of which you intend to buy has a specific unit
                attributed to it. In the same way, a mutual fund has a unit.<br>
                <br>
                NAV is nothing but the price of one unit scheme held by you. Or in more simple terms, suppose you buy a piece of gold
                jewelry and after a few years, you see there is an escalation in gold value, so you decide to trade off your jewelry for
                easy cash.<br>
                <br>
                Here the jewelry is one unit of scheme held by you, the rate at which you sell it is the market value of the one unit of
                a scheme. Now, just like the gold rate may go up and down. In the same way, NAV may increase or decrease depending on
                market conditions.<br>
                <br>
                Net Asset Value in one word is the key indicator of your mutual fund performance.<br>
                <br>
                As we are moving on with the details, let's cover up another area that demands our introspection, which is the advantage
                of a diversified portfolio that mutual funds benefit us with.<br>

                <h3>This jargon may feel way above the head, but what does it mean to you as an investor? And why does everyone keep
                stressing on this feature?</h3>

                <h2>Diversified Financial Portfolio</h2>
                <p>A diversified financial portfolio means diversifying your investment to a number of places. Mutual funds give you this
                tremendous and incredible opportunity to diversify your investment because the more you diversify the more you avert the
                risk of losing your money.<br>
                <br>
                Are you still not sure how it works? Here, let us clarify it more for you:<br>
                <br>
                Let's say you want to surprise your mom on her birthday with an astounding birthday party. But now you also need to take
                care that she doesn't get to know about it. On the same hand, you have to accumulate stuff like balloons, cake,
                decorative materials, candles for her birthday. But, you know if you keep all the stuff in our room she may find out.<br>
                <br>So, in order to keep that an absolute secret you keep some of the stuff in your brother's room some in your neighbor's
                room thereby reducing the probability of her finding out.<br>
                <br>
                Much in the same way, diversification of financial investment helps you to avoid losing your hard-earned money. By now,
                we guess it's clear to you what mutual funds can mean for you and why it should be in your investment bucket list.<br>
                <br>
                All of these may make you ponder on the point that even if you want to invest in a mutual fund, whether can you invest
                through smaller bits of regular investment or not?<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h2>Well, the answer is yes, all your queries and doubts have an answer with us at the Lifetime SOLUTIONS.</h2>

            <h2>SIP or Systematic Investment Plan</h2>
            <p>Through SIP, you can start investing on a regular basis for as low as INR 500 per month. Under this scheme, as an
        investor, you don't need to worry about the timing of the market or market fluctuations as you will be investing in a
        regular way for a good amount of period.<br>
        <br>
        SIP pays off incredibly well by virtue of its compounding magic. It makes you disciplined in managing your finances as
        an investor and pays for your resilience. As a young investor,<br>
        <br>
        seeding your goals and ambitions with SIP is the best way forward as it helps you keep track of your investment at par
        with your goals.<br>
        <br>
        SIP can be very well equated with the proverb that " Little drops of water make up the ocean", even if you are investing
        a small amount, if you are investing regularly at fixed intervals in a disciplined planner, the power of compounding one
        day would make it a big sum of money to look at.<br>
        <br>
        By now, we hope that you are feeling fine and confident about your investment steps. But, it's quite possible that you
        may still have a lot of queries which we totally understand.<br>
